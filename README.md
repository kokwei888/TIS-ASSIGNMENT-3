# REFLECTION

The reflection portion of the assignment allowed each team member to share personal insights gained through the process. This step encouraged introspection and highlighted the practical skills, adaptability, and perseverance required in the fast-changing tech industry. Through this assignment, we not only enhanced our technical and creative skills but also improved teamwork, communication, and time management. The use of Canva demonstrated the importance of leveraging modern tools for efficient content creation, while the reflection emphasized the value of learning from challenges and preparing for real-world demands.
